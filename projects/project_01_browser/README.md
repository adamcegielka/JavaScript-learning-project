# Project 01 - Drink Browser

Welcome to the Drink Browser - a simple, yet effective web application developed as a part of my JavaScript learning journey. This project focuses on demonstrating the functionality of a live search feature within a web application.

## Live Application

Experience the Drink Browser in action: [Drink Browser](https://drink-browser.netlify.app/)

## Project Overview
The Drink Browser is a straightforward web application designed to showcase a dynamic search functionality using JavaScript. It allows users to search through a list of drinks, offering real-time filtering as the user types.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Search:** Implements a live search feature that filters through a list of drinks based on user input.
- **Interactive User Interface:** A clean and responsive design, ensuring a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **JavaScript Practice:** A project focused on applying and demonstrating JavaScript skills, particularly in DOM manipulation and event handling.

## How It Works
1. Visit the Drink Browser.
2. Start typing in the search bar to look for a drink.
3. The list of drinks updates in real-time as you type, showing only the relevant results.

## Technologies
- HTML: Structuring the web page
- CSS: Styling the interface for a pleasant user experience
- JavaScript: Implementing the dynamic search functionality and interactive features

## Learning Outcomes
This project served as a practical exercise in understanding and applying JavaScript, particularly focusing on:

- DOM manipulation: Interacting with the Document Object Model to dynamically update the content
- Event handling: Responding to user inputs in real-time
- Search algorithm: Implementing a basic search algorithm to filter through data

## Future Enhancements
While the current version of the Drink Browser is focused on the search functionality, future enhancements could include:

- Expanding the drink database for a more comprehensive list
- Incorporating additional details about each drink
- Adding features like sorting and categorizing
